            <strong>My Dearest Prisha,</strong>
            <p>
              It’s been a month since we started, and we’ve already faced challenges together and with ease.
              I’m so grateful for your patience and understanding. Thank you for being you.<br><br>
              I’m sorry we haven’t had our first date yet, but we’ll make it happen soon.
              I can’t wait to experience what it’s like to be truly loved by you.
              I know commitment feels scary right now, but I’ll do my best to show you it’s worth the risk.<br><br>
              You’re my dream girl, maybe even the answer to my prayers.
              Cheers to our first month together, and to many more to come.
            </p>
            <strong>With all my love, <br> Mark</strong>
